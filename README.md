Important Note: Unity WON'T be able to start the game if you clone the repository. Photon file is removed as sharing it publicly is against its ToS and license. 
Purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my up to date my code structure and architecture skills. 
In case you are interested to play the game, you may download photon fusion sdk to project or contact to me.
